## Summer Camp Activities

We are going to have 3 activities as separated by three folders.

For each activity script we need to comment/uncomment the path for mex files depending on Mac or Windows machine.

### Activity 1

It has a single script for displaying hover task using NMPC. Students can enter desired x,y,z co-ordinates and see how the drone reach there.

### Activity 2

It has two script:

* Script 1: shows helical trajectory tracking.

* Script 2: shows the drone following a Torus Knot like trajectory.


### Activity 3

It has a single script for making the students understand the benefits/ trade offs in selecting a shorter or longer MPC horizon (i.e. the future time for which the drone's brain can predict). Students can choose out of 6 options for the MPC horizon to obswerve the behavior.
